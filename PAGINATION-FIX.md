# n8n-nodes-gainium Pagination Fix Summary

## Improvements to GET_USER_BALANCES Operation

### Problems Addressed:

1. The GET_USER_BALANCES operation was not properly handling the unique array-based response structure
2. The output format was unnecessarily complex with nested arrays and objects
3. Pagination was not working consistently for different response formats

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Pagination Logic Improvements

- Added explicit `pageSize` parameter to requests to ensure consistent page sizes
- Enhanced detection of different response formats (array-based and object-based)
- Implemented dual-strategy approach for pagination:
  - Primary: Use explicit pagination information when available
  - Fallback: Use page size threshold (500 items) when explicit pagination is not available
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose pagination issues

#### 2. Response Format Simplification

- Changed the output format from:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "balancesData": [
        {
          "data": [ ... individual balance items ... ],
          "pagination": { ... }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

  To a cleaner structure:

  ```json
  {
    "data": [ ... individual balance items ... ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 2,
      "totalPages": 2,
      "totalResults": 600
    }
  }
  ```

#### 3. Consistent Format Across Request Types

- Added special handling for non-paginated GET_USER_BALANCES requests
- Ensured both paginated and non-paginated requests return the same data structure
- Standardized error handling to provide meaningful error messages

### Testing:

- Created a dedicated test script (`test-balances-pagination.js`) to verify pagination functionality
- Added mocks to simulate the API's array-based response format
- Verified that the script correctly aggregates items across multiple pages
- Confirmed the output format is clean and consistent

### Result:

The GET_USER_BALANCES operation now properly handles pagination and returns a clean, consistent response format that makes it easier for users to access the balance data directly without navigating nested structures.

## Next Steps:

For full validation, integration testing should be performed with actual API calls using the n8n workflow environment.
